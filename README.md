# Conway-s-Game-of-Life
0 player game - Conway's Game of Life. Was made without a graphic interface, to help me familiarize myself with Java before starting better projects.

I had done some java programming while in Prague in my second year of studies. This project was made after summer break in my third year of studies as a way to
remind myself of the java syntax and as a contest that I made with some of my friends from Prague. We gave each other a week to do this project while competing on who
would make the best version of the game during that time where we add other things to do.


Description of Conway's Game Of Life :
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game,meaning 
that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and 
observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.
Good examples of this game are showcased on youtube.


What I implemented :
My program runs based on a given initial configuration. The initial configuration is given in the program. It takes into account all of the rules of the Conway's Game
of Life and prints the results into the console. The user has a choice between running the initial configuration or starting a random configuration.

Ways to improve it :
- Add a graphic interface
- Give the user the possibility to personalize the configuration
- Add other initial configurations the user can pick from (configurations that when started show a cool animation)
- Make the project using OOP
